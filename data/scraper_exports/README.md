# Scraper Exports

This folder contains JSON/CSV exports generated by `scrapper/scrapper.py`.

- Files are named like: `gil_vicente_next_opponent_<OPPONENT>_{individual|aggregated}_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.{json|csv}`
- Offline fixtures cache files are named like: `gil_vicente_fixtures_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.{json|csv}`
- The backend can read these exports as a fallback data source when SofaScore blocks API requests (HTTP 403).

Notes:
- This folder is **ignored** by git (except this README).
- You can override the export/search folder via `SCRAPER_EXPORT_DIR` in `.env`.
